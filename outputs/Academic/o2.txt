2. "The increasing use of social media has both positive and negative effects on mental health, with both platforms providing access to information and support for individuals and contributing to the spread of misinformation."
3. "The implementation of standardized testing in education can have a significant impact on student performance, particularly for students from low-income backgrounds who may face significant barriers to accessing quality educational resources."
4. "The rise of single-use plastics has devastating environmental consequences, including pollution, harm to marine life, and increased greenhouse gas emissions."
5. "The impact of artificial intelligence on the job market is multifaceted, with both creating new opportunities for employment and exacerbating existing social inequalities."
