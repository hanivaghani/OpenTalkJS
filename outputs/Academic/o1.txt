Title: Investigating the Impact of Social Media on Mental Health in Young Adults: A Mixed-Methods Study

Abstract:

The widespread use of social media has led to growing concerns about its potential impact on mental health in young adults. This mixed-methods study aimed to investigate the relationship between social media use and mental health outcomes among a sample of 1,000 young adults (18-25 years old). Using a combination of online surveys and focus groups, this study examined the prevalence and correlates of social media use, as well as its effects on symptoms of depression, anxiety, and loneliness. Results showed that excessive social media use was associated with increased symptoms of depression, anxiety, and loneliness, particularly among young adults who reported higher levels of social isolation and life dissatisfaction. The study also found that individuals who used social media to connect with others in person demonstrated better mental health outcomes compared to those who relied solely on online communication. These findings have implications for public health policy and practice, highlighting the need for balanced approaches to social media use that prioritize in-person connections and offline well-being.
