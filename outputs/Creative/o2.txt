In twilight's hush, where shadows play,
The forest whispers secrets of the day.
The trees, like sentinels of old,
Stand guard, their branches tales to unfold.

The wind, a gentle lover's sigh,
Stirs leaves that rustle, a soft goodbye.
The sun, a burning ember high,
Illuminates the landscape's sigh.

The river flows, a winding stream,
Through valleys green, and hills serene.
Its waters sing, a melody sweet,
As fish swim beneath, their secrets to meet.

The mountains rise, a towering spire,
Their peaks, a challenge to the fire.
The air is crisp, the scent of earth,
A fragrance that gives rebirth.

In nature's realm, we find our place,
A tiny part, yet a vital space.
We are connected, intertwined with fate,
In harmony, our lives will wait.

So let us cherish, this world so grand,
And honor the beauty, hand in hand.
For in its depths, we find our own worth,
And a sense of peace, that time and earth can birth.
