**Title:** Missing "Share" Button in Social Media Section

**Description:**

I am experiencing an issue with the social media integration on my account. When I try to share content on various platforms, I encounter a missing button that allows me to share directly from my profile.

**Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Log in to my account
2. Navigate to the "Share" or "Post" section
3. Click on the "Share" or "Post" button (currently not available)
4. Try to click on any other button on the same page

**Expected Result:**

I expect the "Share" or "Post" button to be visible and functional, allowing me to share content directly from my profile.

**Actual Result:**

The missing button is currently absent, making it difficult for me to share content without manually navigating to the social media integration section.
