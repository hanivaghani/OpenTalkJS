I can provide you with an example of code documentation in Markdown format. Here's an example of a Python function documentation:

```python
"""
Project Euler Problem 1: N-Queen Problem

The N-Queen problem is a classic backtracking problem where the goal is to place n queens on an NxN chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.

"""

def solve_n_queens(n):
    """
    Solves the N-Queen problem using backtracking.

    Args:
        n (int): The size of the chessboard.

    Returns:
        list: A 2D list representing the placement of queens on the board.
    """

    def is_safe(board, row, col):
        """
        Checks if it's safe to place a queen at position (row, col) on the board.

        Args:
            board (list): The current state of the board.
            row (int): The row index of the position to check.
            col (int): The column index of the position to check.

        Returns:
            bool: True if it's safe to place a queen, False otherwise.

This code documentation includes:

* A docstring at the top that describes the purpose of the code.
* Function-level comments explaining each function's purpose and parameters.
* Type hints for function arguments and return types to improve code readability and enable tools like type checkers and IDEs to provide suggestions.
* Clear explanations of what each section of the code is doing.
