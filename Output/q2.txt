Silent streams swirl silver shades,
As sunset's warmth on hills is made.
The forest whispers through the trees,
A soothing melody, a gentle breeze.

The stars appear, like diamonds bright,
In twilight sky, a celestial sight.
The world is hushed, in quiet sleep,
Dreams of dawn, and morning deep.

The wind stirs leaves, with rustling sound,
As nature's symphony, all around.
The trees sway free, their branches high,
A dance of life, against the summer sky.

In this wild world, we find our peace,
Where earth and sky, in harmony release.
So let us cherish, this wondrous place,
And honor nature, with a gentle face.
